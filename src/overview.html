The extracted information should enable new reuse possibilities for the digital objects.<br />
PET uses extraction modules to specify which information to extract. There are three kinds of extraction modules: 
Modules that extract file-dependent information, modules that extract environment information that is valid for all files, and daemon modules that monitor the environment for the occurrence of 
events and initiate update extractions.<br />
It is possible to develop customized extraction modules for specialized purposes.<br />
PET provides two user interfaces: A command line interface and an optional graphical user interface.
