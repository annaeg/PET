				+ "<h2>Modules</h2>Modules are used to extract information from the environment. "
				+ "They define a set of formatted information to be extracted and the way of how "
				+ "to extract it.\n"
				+ "Modules always belong to a profile. You can find a list of modules belonging to"
				+ " a specific profile, if you open the profile tab, select a module, and select "
				+ "the modules tab of the selected profile. Here you can browse the module "
				+ "descriptions and configurations, and add additional modules to the profile.\n<br/>"
				+ "There are <b>file dependent modules</b>, that extract information related to a specific"
				+ " file. They will be executed for all files listed in the profile. The second "
				+ "kind of modules are <b>file independent modules</b> that extract environment "
				+ "information which is the same for all files, like system resources.\n"
				+ "A flag displays if the information extracted by a module can change. Only modules"
				+ " with changeable information will be re-extracted in further extractions.\n"
				+ "<b>Daemon modules</b> monitor the system environment for the occurrence of specific events.\n<br/>"
				+ "Some modules can be configured to serve for special needs, see <b>Module Configuration</b>\n"
				+ "It is possible to develop further modules that satisfy special needs. Have a look at the "
				+ "shipped module developer documentation.<hr \\>";
		htmlString += "<h2>Configuration of modules</h2>All modules can be enabled or disabled. Only enabled "
				+ "modules will be used for extraction, while disabled modules are inactive. Disabled "
				+ "modules are shown in red letters at the list.\n"
				+ "Some modules need further configuration. They will disable themselves, if "
				+ "necessary configuration is missing. For other modules further configuration "
				+ "is optional. The module description should explain how to configure a module.<hr \\>";
		htmlString += "<h2>Profiles</h2>Profiles include a set of configured modules and a set of <b>monitored files</b>. They "
				+ "can be used to separate files and modules by purpose. It is possible to "
				+ "disable whole profiles to exclude them from any extraction process. Give your "
				+ "profiles meaningful names to improve the recall value.\n"
				+ "You can start a <b>Single Extraction</b> for a profile exclusively by using the option "
				+ "Extract only profile from the pofile lists pop up menu.\n"
				+ "Note, that it is probably not wise to send a whole profile to another PET user, "
				+ "because some files couldn't exist on the other environment. Have a look at profile templates"
				+ " for this purpose.<hr \\>";
		htmlString += "<h2>Templates</h2>Profile templates serve as template to create new profiles. They "
				+ "predefine a set of configured modules to serve a special need.\n"
				+ "Existing Profiles can be exported as templates from the pop up menu of the list "
				+ "of profiles in the profile tab.\n"
				+ "Templates are stored in the /PET/config/profile_templates/ directory and can "
				+ "be send to other PET users to share profile configurations.<hr \\>";
		htmlString += "<h2>Extraction modes</h2>The Pericles Extraction Tool can extract environment information"
				+ " in two extraction modes:\n"
				+ "In the <b>Continuous Extraction</b>-mode information will be extracted continuously "
				+ "while the tool runs in the background and monitores the environment for the occurence "
				+ "of events. If, for example, a file belonging to a profile was modified, PET will detect"
				+ " the modification and initiate a re-extraction of the modules that extract information "
				+ "that could have changed. The coninuous mode allows to capture the change of environment"
				+ " information over time.\n"
				+ "The <b>Single Extraction</b>-mode will extract all modules once. It allows to take a snapshot"
				+ " of the current environment information, which is useful to compare different states of the"
				+ " environment or before passing digital objects to another environment.<hr \\>";
		htmlString += "<h2>Environment information</h2>"
				+ "Environment information are file-independent information belonging to a profile and extracted by the "
				+ "file-independent modules of that profile." + "<hr \\>";
		htmlString += "<h2>Events</h2>"
				+ "At the events-tab all events recorded by daemon modules are listed."
				+ "<hr \\>";
		htmlString += "</body></html>";
