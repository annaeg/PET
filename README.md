PERICLES Extraction Tool - PET 

The tool was created by Fabio Corubolo at University of Liverpool and Anna Eggers from University of Gottingen. The tool was created to capture significant environment information from live environments to better support object use and reuse, in the scope of long-term preservation of data, i.e.  the aim of the tool is to collect important environmental information from the context of use of the data, that could be lost if not gathered at that right time. 
The tool has been entirely created with the PERICLES project http://pericles-project.eu/.

The tool has not been released at this time, as we are waiting authorisation for its licensing. The process is already in act and the tool should be avalaible soon.
