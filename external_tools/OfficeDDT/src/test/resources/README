For each of the file types, there are test files for each version of Office.
Well, there should be, but I don't have copies of Office earlier than 2003.

The folder structure at the moment should be

testfiles
|---- xls
|   |---- 2003
|   |   |----chart-from-source.xls
|   |   |----chart-pasted.xls
|   |   |----formulas.xls
|   |   |----insert-as-object.xls
|   |   |----pivot-tables.xls
|   |	|----paste-as-link-text.xls
|   |	|----paste-as-link-doc.xls
|   |---- 2007
|   |   |----chart-from-source.xls
|   |   |----chart-pasted.xls
|   |   |----formulas.xls
|   |   |----insert-as-object.xls
|   |   |----pivot-tables.xls
|   |---- 2010
|---- ppt
|   |---- 2003
|   |	|----insert-as-object.ppt
|   |	|----paste-as-link-doc.ppt
|   |	|----paste-as-link-other.ppt

Where folders named after an office version contain files created by that version of office.
All of the version folders should contain the same files to make it easy to get a consistent set of
test files across versions.

The expected results are:

As is fairly obvious, the dependencies are files that are created by different versions of office again.
Each file represents a mechanism for linking files. For instance, chart-from-source.xls contains
charts that use data from the '20xx-chartsource.xls' files.

the mechanisms that have been tested so far are:

 * chart-from-source: a chart created with source data from a different workbook.
 * chart-pasted: a chart created in a nother workbook, pasted into this workbook.
 * formulas: a formula referencing another workbook.
 * insert-as-object: another OLE file inserted as an OLE object (linked). This file should contain all three types of files linked in by this mechanism. That is, it should have a .doc, a .xls and a .ppt file inserted as an object for each version.
 * pivot-tables: a pivot table referencing data from another workbook.
 * paste-as-link-text: text that has been inserted with paste special->as link->as text and as unicode text. This file should have data pasted both as 'normal' text and as unicode text. 
 * paste-as-link-doc: files pasted into the file by paste-special -> as link -> as document. This should contain all three document types pasted in like this. In fact it depends on what file type it is. Paste-as-link-doc.xls contains a word doc that has been paste-special'ed as a document, and a ppt *slide* that has been paste-special'ed as a powerpoint slide object.
 * paste-as-link-other: contains misc other paste-special type stuff. paste-as-link-other has had a chart object, a range of cells in a spreadsheet, a single slide and a text range paste-special'ed into it.


If any other files/tests are added to the project, they should be noted in here.

 * not picking up the links in insert-as-object.ppt or paste-as-link-other.ppt.
