Description
The Dependency Discovery Tool searches through binary office files (.doc, .xls and .ppt) and tries to find any documents or files that are linked to the document. 

It is written in java, using the Apache POI libraries ( http://poi.apache.org )

This project was part of a summer scholarship from the School of Engineering and Computer Science at Victoria University, Wellington (http://ecs.vuw.ac.nz) in conjunction with Archives New Zealand ( http://archives.govt.nz ). 

At the moment it requires Java 6 to build and run, but this should change soon, and it will run on Java 5 upwards.



-------------BUILDING-----------------------------

To build this, you need some flavour of java (version >= 5), junit4 and Apache Ant (ant.apache.org).
Once you have that installed, simply run 

     $ ant dist

in the folder with 'build.xml' in it, and it will build OfficeDDT.jar in the 'dist' folder. The build script uses two variables that you may need to set,
* poi.libs.dir is the directory that the poi libraries reside in (defaults to ./lib)
* junit.libs.dir is the directory that the junit library is in (defaults to /usr/share/java)

Once it has compiled, running 

     $ java -jar dist/OfficeDDT.jar

will give you the usage summary for the main program. 

If you want to build the javadocs run

     $ ant javadoc

they will end up in dist/doc.

Otherwise just run 'ant' without any arguments and you can see all of the useful build targets. 


---------------NOTES-----------------------------

* It is not really finished. And the build script is very fragile.
